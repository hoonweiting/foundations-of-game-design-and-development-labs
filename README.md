# foundations-of-game-design-and-development-labs

A repository containing all my lab work for 50.033 Foundations of Game Design and Development! (Maybe I should have created the repositories on a per-lab basis, but oh well, what's done is done.)

Not sure what the best way of using git with Unity is, but because of how my repository is set up, I had to modify the standard Unity `.gitignore` file a little (the alternative was to move it into each lab's folder). Other than that, I'm not sure if I should have adjusted some settings in the Unity projects themselves (see [this StackOverflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21573405/how-to-prepare-a-unity-project-for-git)). Then there's also git LFS for tracking large files, which I don't really get, nor know if it's applicable to this project (plus there's a quota of 1GB of free storage and free bandwidth per month for each account, I'll need to pay to get more). And then there's also this [GitHub for Unity extension](https://unity.github.com/).
