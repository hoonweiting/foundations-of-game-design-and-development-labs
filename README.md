# foundations-of-game-design-and-development-labs

A repository containing all my lab work for 50.033 Foundations of Game Design and Development! (Maybe I should have created the repositories on a per-lab basis, but oh well, what's done is done.)

Currently figuring out the best way to use git here. I will probably need to add a the `.gitignore` file to each lab's folder (or modify some of the items), and adjust some settings in the Unity projects themselves (see [this StackOverflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21573405/how-to-prepare-a-unity-project-for-git)). Then there's also git LFS for tracking large files, which I don't really get, nor know if it's applicable to this project (plus there's a quota of 1GB of free storage and free bandwidth per month for each account, I'll need to pay to get more). And then there's also this [GitHub for Unity extension](https://unity.github.com/).
